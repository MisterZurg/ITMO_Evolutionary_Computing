# Discipline
Evolutionary Computing

## Instructors
[Mikhail Melnik](https://github.com/HighExecutor) Associate Professor of Digital Transformation

## Labs
### Lab 1 Introduction to evolutionary computation
> Goal is to edit Genetic Algorithm setup in such a way that the algorithm would be able to solve classic optimization function (shifted reversed Rastrigin function). 
> You need to set dimension to 100. Don't forget this. This will increase complexity of function.
> The maximum value that you can achieve is 10.0, but lets say you want to achieve results with quality > 9.5.

### Lab 2 Designing an evolutionary algorithm for the queen placement problem 
> Implement solving of Queens Puzzle with evolutionary algorithm. For example, [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).
> The goal is to design algorithm that would solve queens puzzle with at least 8x8 board. But you can try bigger sizes. As a pattern you can use the same script as for 1st assignment, but modify all required things to work with discrete problem. It is > important to design how you will encode solution (how you represent a solution in a code)  and design correspond mutation\crossover operators. 
> Try to print in console your best found solution at the end of your script.
